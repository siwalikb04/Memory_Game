            <li>Repeat the sequence: After the game shows you the sequence, it's your turn. Press the color buttons in the same order that the game showed you.</li><hr>
            <li>Keep up: The game will continue to add more steps to the sequence each time you successfully repeat it. The sequence gets longer and faster as you progress.</li><hr>
            <li>Don't make a mistake: If you press a wrong button or press them in the wrong order, you lose.</li>
